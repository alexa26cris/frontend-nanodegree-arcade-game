Features
The game has 16 cards and 8 pairs in total.
The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. It begins with 3 stars, after 14 moves, it changes to a 2 star rating, and after 22 moves to 1 star rating.
The player can reset the game board anytime by clicking on the Restart button.
The timer starts when the player starts the game and it stops when he wins the game.
